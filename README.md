# basketballscorekeeper

Hello, this project is essentially a prototype to demonstrate some of my coding abilities. The application is a scorekeeper/live blog
platform for basketball games. The idea is that someone would be able to watch a basketball game, keep score for it, and add 
commentary periodically on the game. When a comment is submitted it gets added to a queue of messages that are timestamped with the
time in the game and the game score.
This app was built using the React JS and the React Flux architecture. Additionally, gulp and browserify to build the app. A live 
version of this application can be seen at http://mickycconsulting.com/basketball
